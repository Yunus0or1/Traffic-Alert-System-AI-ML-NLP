# Traffic-alert-system-AI-ML-NLP
A traffic alert system using Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. Website developed in Django.

Think of a situation where people get stucked in traffic jam at the same road daily. But it can be easily avoided if the exact time of traffic jam news can be circulated. This project  inteds to circulate the traffic jam news accross various user. Whenever someone gets stucked in traffic jam and sends out the news via this website , the back-end code will immediately detects what the user is saying whether there is traffic jam or not or either the user is just trying to know the road situation. There is also a custom made NER which detects the place name where the traffic jam is occuring. This is rather a good project for beginners for learning ML,AI and NLP.
